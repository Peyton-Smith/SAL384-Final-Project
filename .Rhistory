# SAL384-Final-Project
Santino Primerano and Peyton Smith's final project for SAL 384
`SAL384_Final_Project_Primerano_Smith.ipynb`
Includes code to scrape data and model which regular season stats best for determining NHL playoff success since the NHL changed its playoff format in the 2013-2014 season?
`Data/Final_Project_Data_Merged.csv`
Includes all regular season stats for every NHL team from the 2013-2014 season to the last complete NHL season (2018-2019) and dummy variables for whether a team won a playoff series, whether they had home-ice advantage, and whether the team was a division leader or a wild card team. This data was scrapped from Natural Stat Trick and used in our logit regression.
